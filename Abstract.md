Condensation Based Finite Element Optimization for Structural Problems

The project deals with topology optimization with respect to the structure of an engine pylon on a standard aircraft. Using the finite element method, the engine is representatively modeled to then project a representative load onto the design zone i.e. the pylon, which will then undergo a topological optimization. To account for engine architectures with variable thicknesses, we first integrate geometrical aspects of the engine to the decision variables of the design zone. To further simplify the representative engine, we use static and dynamic condensation techniques to suppress certain degrees of freedom to reduce the time complexity associated with the optimization problem.
